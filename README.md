# Data Structures and Algorithms in C
Welcome to the DSA in C repository.\
This repo contains ***my own implementations*** of fundamental data structures and algorithms coded in the C programming language. It is designed to help beginners and enthusiasts understand how classic algorithms and data structures work under the hood.\

It also contains implementations of OS algorithms and a basic project of windows API.
